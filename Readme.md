The Slide Puzzle Game
Rules:
The rules consist in setting the image piece back in order once they are shuffle.
1.Click on the image next to the empty space to move and it will swap sides.
2.The first time you start the game if you shuffle it wont count as a move, but after that every time you shuffle will
count as a move.
3.The game will keep track of you score even if you refresh the browser.
4.The best score is stored in a local file.

This project uses the Dom to manipulate the html file constantly and make it dinamic, the grid
was created and then filled using the background image position to create an ilusion of the full picture.
We used the play and music functions for the audio, and local storage to save score and moves.
The is still some functionality that can be added like changing the audio track accordingly to the image,
adding a timer and a difficulty level.
